Requirements:
1. C compiler - clang 3.1, gcc 4.8, msvc 16.9, those are minimum versions because of ASan.
2. Raylib
3. Basic POSIX support

Those are the requirements.

Windows NT:
I compiled hammer engine using w64devkit i find it easy to
use. Compile it unix style.

Unix:
In you implementation file(used impl.c for example) you must have:
#define HAMMER_ENGINE_IMPLEMENTATION

Before compiling, we have to know what compiler you want to use and where are libs.

Examples:
// my machine
CC=clang-mp-19 INC=/opt/local/include LIBS_PATH=/opt/local/lib bsdmake

// your machine(probably)
CC=gcc INC=/usr/include LIBS_PATH=/usr/lib make

To enable optimizations and release the engine just pass release flag:
CC=gcc INC=/usr/inc LIBS_PATH=/usr/lib make release

To make development easier just use alias:
alias compile="CC=gcc INC=... LIBS_PATH=..."
